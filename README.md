# Project Description

The project is a prototype system that uses Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) technology to detect hazards (e.g., fire, intrusion) in a home environment. It consists of a sender platform connected to sensors and a receiver platform that triggers alarms and sends alerts via both light-based communication and Bluetooth.

# Key Features
-Hazard Detection: Monitors for fire, door opening, and intrusion.

-Li-Fi Communication: Transmits alerts using visible light.

-Alarms: Triggers a lamp, buzzer, and LCD display on hazard detection.

-Bluetooth Alerts: Sends notifications to a mobile app.

-Control Buttons: Includes start/stop and mute functionalities.
